Edudito is an education platform for students, teachers, and enthusiastic learners.  
Due to covid-19 disease, students -specially elementary grade- were unable to have an educational environment in schools.  
Our solution is provide these students an interactive and enjoyable learning platform.

This is the only platform that you can share you fails before your successes!
You can share your own fails and mistakes to reach the right answers , which develops the learning processes using immersive experience!

## PROJECT SUMMARY

![mockup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50237142/113069386-82d9eb00-91c0-11eb-9ceb-7c63c8e5edd8.jpeg)

Edudito connects the people who want to learn and who want to teach. It helps people
who cannot go to school to learn, like girls in the rural areas and people with physical
disabilities. With the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), some
schools use a hybrid mix of in-person and remote (online) learning since it is not safe for
students to go to school) and thorough Edudito They will be able to improve learning
outcomes through increasing engagement and interactivity safely.

A single system user is available. The user can choose whether to learn through the
available online environments or to teach by creating his environment. The user logs in, and
the system directs him to the user interface. In this module, there is an option to create an
environment through uploading materials like PPT, PDF, and video will allow the user to
develop courses within a database and create/use 3D models with AR technology. The user
can select one or more subjects. At his convenience, he can study, create a roadmap and view
his progress report and participate online with other users.

## QUALITY EDUCATION
Quality education is one of 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. The achievement of effective and inclusive education for everyone
confirms that education is one of the critical and most proven tools for sustainable
development. This goal guarantees free primary and secondary schooling for all girls and
children by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training and
eliminate gender and wealth disparities to achieve universal access to a qualityو higher
education.
Edudito allows learners to practice in a realistic environment through augmented 3D
models. Users can contact, touch and view objects which require gesticulations of user-touch.
Learners can interactively engage in simulations to experience course material from different
dimensions. It can also foster collaboration between learners and instructors and the adoption
of new views and perspectives.
It is the flip side of traditional education techniques that mainly instructors lead education
processes. It is an effective educational process through which learners practice modern
techniques by visualizing interactive models. AR can help the student understand the
courses; for example, it will enable physiology students to view the human body system in
three dimensions.

## APPLICATION BENEFITS

![mockup1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50237142/113069724-45c22880-91c1-11eb-87fe-1fcaf9d8c4fb.jpeg)

A faster and efficient learning process in education: AR in education helps students to
achieve better results by displaying and fully immersing themselves in the subject. Instead of
reading theory about something, students can see it with their own eyes in action. As far as high-
level educational students are concerned, AR can help them understand the subject by visualizing
the spatial structure and the interactive models that appear in-camera images, improving learners&#39;
ability to remember what they have learned – and to acquire information and skills more quickly.

- Practical learning effectiveness by improving understanding of abstract and
spatial geometrical concepts by multi-angle observation of virtual 3D objects.

- Improving efficient medical training by enabling students in physiology to view
the human body system through the human body in an interactive 3D format.

- Allowing students to practice chemical experiments in a safer environment than
handling chemicals in real life.

- Universally applicable to any level of education and training: from learning games
for kindergarten to on-the-job training, AR is not limited to only one use case or
field of application.

- Removing of geographical barriers (Learning anywhere).

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, an AR mobile application for education can improve the understanding of
courses by engaging in real life. Besides, learners will find it more exciting and fun to practice in
an interactive environment. Edudito would therefore enable learners to acknowledge, realize and practice
interactive courses. It grabs the attention of learners, makes them more interested in learning.
